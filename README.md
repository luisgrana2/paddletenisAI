# Paddle vs Tennis Classification Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Paddle vs Tennis Classification Project! This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to distinguish between images of paddle and tennis sports. By leveraging advanced image processing and classification techniques, our goal is to accurately classify images into either the paddle or tennis category. This project is ideal for demonstrating skills in image classification and machine learning.

## Project Description

This project uses computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify images of paddle and tennis. We apply image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification methods to achieve high accuracy. The end result is a robust classifier that can differentiate between the two sports based on image data.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Techniques for noise reduction, normalization, and enhancement.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilization of advanced features for better classification accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various models to find the best classifier.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representation of results including decision boundaries and confusion matrices.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paddle-vs-tennis-classification.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd paddle-vs-tennis-classification
    ```

3. **Install required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the classifier, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset:** Ensure that your images are organized into 'paddle' and 'tennis' directories within the `data` folder.
2. **Run the training script:**

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Evaluate the model:**

    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```

4. **Classify new images:**

    ```bash
    python classify_images.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
    ```

## Data

The dataset for this project consists of labeled images of paddle and tennis. The images are organized into two directories: `data/paddle` and `data/tennis`. Ensure your dataset follows this structure for the code to work correctly.

## Model Training

We used various machine learning models for classification, including:

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

The best-performing model was selected based on cross-validation and evaluation metrics.

## Evaluation

Model performance was evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the classifier's performance.

## Results

The project results indicate the accuracy and effectiveness of the classifier in distinguishing between paddle and tennis images. Visualizations include confusion matrices and decision boundaries that illustrate the model's performance.
